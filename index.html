            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 900;">Welcome to the official website of Dr. Robert Hare.</span> Since the 1960’s, Dr. Hare has focused on understanding psychopathy—a condition that has both fascinated and troubled him throughout his career. His goal has always been to bring clarity to this complex personality disorder, to lift the veil on behaviors that impact not only individuals but also families, communities, and society as a whole.</p>
            <p>Through the development of the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R), Dr. Hare sought to provide a practical and reliable tool for identifying psychopathy. This work was born out of his desire to help professionals across psychology, criminology, and justice fields better recognize and understand individuals who possess a profound lack of empathy, remorse, and conscience. Psychopathy remains one of the most misunderstood and, often, underestimated conditions, and Dr. Hare has dedicated his career to changing that.</p>
            <p>This website is designed to share Dr. Hare's research, reflections, and the progress that has been made in understanding psychopathy. Here, visitors will find resources that are useful to students, researchers, practitioners, and anyone interested in the subject. Dr. Hare aims to provide insight into the traits and behaviors that define psychopathy, the methods used to study it, and the societal implications of this knowledge.</p>
            <p>Visitors are invited to explore the materials presented here and to engage with the content critically. The study of psychopathy is not just an academic pursuit—it is an effort to understand the darker facets of human behavior and, ultimately, to mitigate the harm they cause. Thank you for your interest in Dr. Hare's work, and we hope you find the information here both thought-provoking and enlightening.</p>

            <p>Dr. Robert Hare’s Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) stands as a cornerstone in the research and clinical assessment of psychopathy. Developed with scientific rigor, the PCL-R has established itself as an international standard for identifying the personality, interpersonal, and behavioral traits associated with psychopathy. Its contributions span across mental health, criminal justice, and even corporate environments, helping professionals understand and address the profound effects psychopathy can have on individuals and society.</p>
            <p>The PCL-R equips professionals across disciplines to recognize psychopathic traits and their impact, guiding essential decisions in treatment, risk assessment, and public safety. Dr. Hare’s pioneering work with the PCL-R has clarified psychopathy’s complex and often misunderstood nature, bridging clinical research with real-world applications that influence public policy and safeguard communities.</p>
